# model-gallery

## Overview
The purpose of this repo is to curate a collection of configration files that work with the [LocalAI](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI) project. Specifically these are tuned to work with CUDA acceleration, tested on a Debian 11 deep learning vm in GCP with an attached Nvidia L4. 

## Usage
To use these models, you will need to have [LocalAI](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI) built and running on your machine.
